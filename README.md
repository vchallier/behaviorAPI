# behaviorAPI

Test API running with MongoDB and Flask. 

Clone the repo, set up a local mongodb connection and run the app.py script on top of it to have a local API taking POST/GET/DELETE requests. This is a first try, more to come with new methods and more detailed setup explanations.

You have to install mongodb and python. We'll be using the librairies flask and PyMongo (see requirements file)

When ready, type mongod to start a local mongo instance (don't forget to build your data/db folder), and run the flask app with the command python app.py

You're then ready to start sending requests!
